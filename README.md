## Welcome to Deskbird-Assessment-UI
This application overall show my coding style and ability to use resources which have never been used before (PrimeNG),
it is not fully finished, like in any project, features can be added indefinitely, and it is just matter of time, but I can iterate some of them:
- Translation such as Transloco
- Registration page
- isAdmin flag changed to user groups
- Table pagination or infinite scroll
- Refresh token feature
- Dark theme for vampires
etc.
